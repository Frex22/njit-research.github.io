# NJIT's Github Org for Research

Welcome to NJIT's Github Organization for Research. 

## Getting an account

Faculty can request a Team within our Research Org. by submitting a request to Service Now. Once the request is approved, a Team will be created for the Faculty and an invite will be sent to the Faculty to join the Team. Once the invitation is accepted, the faculty will be made the maintainer of the Team. As a Team maintainer, you can invite your collaborators to join as team members. You can also create sub teams if you prefer so that you can set access permissions for your team members.
