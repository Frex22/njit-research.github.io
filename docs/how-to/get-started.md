??? question "How do I get access to NJIT's Github Enterprise Cloud?"
    * Faculty can request a Team in our research or academic org by sending a service now request.
         * If you use Github for research and teaching, you need to request access to both orgs. An account on one org does not grant access to the other org.
         * Once your request has been approved, you will receive a invite to join the org. After you have accepted the invite, you will be promoted to Team Maintainer to enable you to create sub teams and invite collaborators.
    * If you are a student or researcher, your research/faculty advisor can add you to their Team. Please ask your advisor to request a Team in our org if they do not have one.
    * You need to have a Github personal account with your NJIT email as a primary or alternate email. 
    * __ARCS will send an invite to your ucid@njit.edu email only__.
    * Your team name will be your __FirstName LastName__ so that we can identify the team owner. If you want a different name, please feel free to create a sub-team with your preferred name and add collobarator to the sub-team rather than your top level team.
    * __Requests to create a top level team with a different name will be denied__.

??? question "How do I give access to NJIT's Github Enterprise Cloud to an external collaborator?"
    * External Collaborators cannot be given access to NJIT's Github Enterprise Cloud. 
    * However, external collaborators can be given access to repositories in the Research Org only. Note that access has to be given to individual repositories.
    * The Academics Org, for course use, is internal to NJIT only and cannot be shared with external collaborators.
