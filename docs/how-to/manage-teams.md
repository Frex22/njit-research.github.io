??? question "Why do we have teams or sub-teams?"
    * Teams or sub-teams allows you to share your repositories privately with organization members. 
    * For example: 
          1. You are an instructor for HPC101 every semester wherein students develop software collaboratively using github. You might want to create a sub-team for each semester so that students from one semester do not access repos of students from another semester. 
          2. You have two collaborative research projects with two other research groups and want to keep repos private to each set of collaborators. This can be achieved by creating a sub-team for each project.

??? question "Faculty: How do I add a sub-team?"
    __Creating sub-teams is optional and self service once you have been promoted to a Team Maintainer. There is no name restriction (other than already used names) for sub-teams. It is strongly recommended that you use a name that reflects your research project. For courses, it is recommended that you use course number and semester for e.g. HPC101-Spring25__

    1. Navigate to your Team by clicking the Teams tab on the Organization page.
    2. Click on your name (Faculty) to enter your Team page.
         a. Absolute path to your team in an org, for e.g. njit-research org is https://github.com/orgs/njit-research/teams/firstname-lastname (all lowercase)
    3. Click the Teams tab on top left
    3. Click the Green Button that says "Add a team".
    4. On the pop up window, add the sub-team name that you want to create and click the "team name (Create team)" drop down.
    5. To complete creating the team, add a Description (optional) and select an appropriate radio button for your team visibility and notifications followed by the green "Create team" button. 
         a. Team Settings can be changed at any time.
